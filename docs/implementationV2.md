# Wayland: Overview and Implementation Workflow

## Overview  

Wayland is a display protocol that facilitates communication between clients (applications) and the compositor (display server). It enables efficient graphics rendering by exchanging **requests** and **events** between objects. The entire lifecycle of a Wayland application typically involves:  

1. **Connecting to the Wayland Server**  
   - The client establishes a connection to the Wayland compositor using `wl_display`.  
   - This connection allows the client to send requests and receive events.  

2. **Discovering and Binding Global Interfaces**  
   - The client queries the compositor for available **global objects**, such as `wl_compositor`, `wl_shm`, and `wl_seat`.  
   - These objects provide essential functionalities like rendering surfaces, managing input devices, and handling shared memory.  

3. **Handling Input Events**  
   - User input (keyboard, mouse, touch) is received via `wl_seat`, `wl_pointer`, `wl_keyboard`, or `wl_touch`.  
   - The compositor sends input events to the client, which can process them and respond accordingly.  

4. **Creating and Managing a Surface**  
   - The client requests a `wl_surface` from `wl_compositor`, representing a drawable area (window).  
   - A buffer (`wl_buffer`) is attached to the surface, providing pixel data for rendering.  

5. **Rendering and Buffer Management**  
   - Wayland allows clients to render using shared memory (`wl_shm`) or GPU buffers.  
   - Buffers are allocated, filled with pixel data, and submitted to the compositor for display.  

6. **Event-Driven Updates and Synchronization**  
   - Clients use `wl_display_dispatch` to process incoming events and `wl_display_flush` to send requests.  
   - The compositor notifies clients when a buffer is ready for reuse via `wl_callback`.  

7. **Committing and Displaying Frames**  
   - When ready, the client **commits** the buffer to the surface, prompting the compositor to display the frame.  
   - The compositor schedules rendering and synchronizes buffer swaps to avoid tearing.  

### Summary Flow  

1. Client connects to Wayland server
2. Client binds global interfaces
3. Client listens for input events
4. Client creates a surface
5. Client renders to a buffer
6. Client commits buffer for display
7. Compositor displays frame and signals completion

This model ensures efficient rendering and low-latency graphics display while maintaining smooth interactions.
